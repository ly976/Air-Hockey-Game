# Air-Hockey-Game
< br />
•	Simulated a robotic system to play air-hockey game that required Robot I to behave autonomously while Robot II is controlled by a human remotely using JAVA programming <br />
•	Set up a surveillance camera taken five pictures per second to simulate a tracking system, and applied image processing technique (content-based image retrieval) to extract the location of robots and ball based on HSV database, as well as utilized spatial noise reduction to preprocess images to achieve better matching <br />
•	Designed an algorithm for Robot I to find the shortest way to meet with the ball if the ball does not reach the goal, otherwise updated the Graph User Interface (GUI) implemented by JAVA SWING <br />
•	Send the above information to Lego NXT brick via LeJOS under the OBEX protocol thus to realize the Bluetooth connection between PC and Robot, and converted the received data into readable instructions including a distance that Robot I should move forward, an angle that it should rotate and an action (e.g. moving, shooting) <br />
•	Enabled automatic robot to move to the ball and the goal efficiently, and defeat most robot controlled by human <br />
